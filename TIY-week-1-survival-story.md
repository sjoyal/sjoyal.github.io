## Week 1 in the books - TIY

Week 1 at **The Iron Yard -- Orlando** is officially in the books. Jeebus. Like a lot of the other members in my cohort, I must've read tens upon tens (they get repetitive people) of blog posts from students of various TIY campuses while I prepped for my course to begin. No one undersold it, and yet I still feel....undersold? Everything has gone as expected - I wake up thinking Developer tools and JavaScript, I go to sleep thinking Developer tools and JavaScript - yet everything hasn't gone as expected at the same time. It would be easy to start a countdown until the end, or a progress bar that says _You are 8.333% complete with the Front End Engineering course_. But really, I've already learned so much, and there is so much more to learn, that I think another countdown might be necessary: _11 weeks until distractions creep back into my life and slow the learning process down_. That's a scary thought.

So what have I learned? I'd say it's been a proper mix of information about developers, the tools developers use, and the always lovable JavaScript.

##### I said I wanted to be what, exactly?
So what do developers do anyway? The ongoing joke in class is developers are glorified typists. It's funny becuase it's partially true. There has been typing, typing, and more typing. AOL instant messenger certainly didn't prepare me to hit the backtick key, or the backslash. Btw, how many non-developers think they are using backslash, but they're really hitting forward slash? Gotta be like > 75% right? Developers type. And it takes time to get proficient at it. Developers also think. They automate things to make life easier for others. They break down tasks to their most granular level so that instructions can be given in a way computers understand. Those instructions form the basis for the simplest programs. And only after the smallest simplest programs have been created can they be combined to build something large. Developers compose.

```
3 main principals for developers
  1) Build stuff the simplest way possible until you can't
  2) YAGNI - You Ain't Gonna Need It
  3) If tempted to copy / paste, you're probably doing it wrong
```

In class this week, we worked through the initial stages of creating a "To do" list program. The focus of the exercise was to begin to think like a developer - To use an _outside-in_ approach when conceptualizing what features a program should have, and an _inside-out_ approach on how each individual feature should work. We used [Test Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) principles for approaching each feature, including creating user stories and corresponding tests, so that the scope remained narrow with proper Separation of Concerns. The exercise was eye opening for me, someone who has always tried to jump from A to D without any mind to B and C. I'm interested to see if I can apply what I've learned on our next project.

```
Proper testing
  1) Write tests that describe what we want the robot to do
  2) When done correctly, tests should fail at first (going red)
  3) Build code to correct the failure (going green)
```

##### You mentioned developer tools?
I mean....I think they would be called developer tools. Things like Git, atom, homebrew, cask, slack, etc. They are all things that are essential to and make life easier for a developer, so I'll call them tools. Git, or GitHub, is a revision control tool that allows developers within a team to each work on portions of a project and pull work into a master file when appropriate. It's overwhelming and slightly confusing at first, but repitition helps. Repitition and mantras, that is. Through using Git (a command line tool for working with GitHub locally) everyone in the cohort has gotten very familiar with the phrase "git status, git add, git commit". Atom is the text editor of choice we use to write our JavaScript files, Homebrew and cask don't need to be discussed, and slack is like AOL chat rooms and instant messenger, but with a waaaay better GUI and modern features. I'm sure we'll be using more tools going forward, but it's definitely been an adventure learning all of these.

##### Speaking of the command line
My pops showing me how to work in MS-DOS back in '94 ended up paying off! It helped me pick up the commands I needed to use in Terminal quickly. The thing I'm most proud of after our first week of class is that I can control my computer from the command line. That, and the fact that my Terminal isn't white anymore. Or that I'm finally learning shortcut keys so I don't need to use a mouse often. Yep, all that stuff. They say controlling a machine this way will impress potential employers. No word on what it does for the ladies.

##### JavaScript....sigh `Boolean("I'm learning JavaScript, but have 99.9% of it left to learn")`
This stuff is hard. Admittedly, I didn't get enough pre-work done before class started. Even if I had, it's becoming pretty clear that having a program tell you what to code, and giving you small snippets of syntax to type, pales in comparison to starting from a blank .js file. We've covered basic literal types, operators, fucntions, arrays, array methods, if...else, for loops, while loops, and more. Most of it is pretty intuitive, but like any other language there are exceptions to rules and things that just don't make sense. I'm confident things will click. I'm not confident I'll get much sleep in the meantime.

##### Coding bootcamp week 1 "tips for survival"
In honor of my finishing the first week, I've created the following list of tips that I would recommend to anyone set to begin a cohort. All views and opinions are my own, and also basically facts.

**Coding Bootcamp: Tips for surviving week 1**
  * 1) Only stop working on classwork and/or additional JavaScript practice to eat, sleep, shower, and drive
    * Think I'm kidding? This blog was assigned for class. Get off me.
  * 2) Vary the topic / assignment you're working on with regularity
    * Learning JavaScript defnitions is necessary. It's also not fun. Do some fun online codeschool programs to reinforce the definitions and/or any other assignments that need to be done. Vary the routine. It helps me.
  * 3) It's never too early to build something
    * See earlier comment about online codeschools not meaning a whole lot when you're staring at a blank .js file
    * Be reasonable with your expectations of what you can accomplish starting out
    * I built a paper rock scissors game; It's lame, it took me 6 hours, and it just runs on the command line, but I'm 72% sure I built it right...which is nice.
  * 4) Drink hot tea because everyone else drinks coffee, and that stuff stunts your growth.
