## TIY Week 2 - Treading Water Barely

##### What the effffff just happened?

Emphasis on the **F**. I just read my entry for week 1. It sounds remarkably upbeat and almost giddy with excitement. Who wrote that? All the things I was so positive about got rocked in the worst possible way during week 2. Git and github? el.oh.el. Practically everything I thought I was grasping turned out to be lie. How was I supposed to know what merge conflicts were? The fearless leader threw us into that fire firsthand this week. Learn by doing, he says. At least that means I followed directions properly since I avoided the problem until his intended face smack. Learning the fundamentals of JavaScript in week 1 was borderline fun. Applying those to elements in the DOM? Not so much. At least I have the command line. That still works as it should. And at least we have in class homework review. We all get to see that we're equally _dum_.

##### Recapping the week..
Apparently one of our rituals is a Monday morning quiz? The goal is to see how we're retaining the information from the previous week...and every week before that, which is lovely. I actually don't mind the quizzes. They're pretty entertaining considering our brains aren't exactly razor sharp at 9 a.m. after the weekend. And it's not like I'm getting kicked out if/when I bomb them. So yeah, quizzes man. This week we built on the things we began learning in week 1. We pushed forward on ~~good ole~~ JavaScript, covering some concepts like referential transparency, variable naming conventions, dot operators, and the components of functions. Then got into using JavaScript in the DOM (curse you eventListeners), Chrome's developer console, dictionaries (kind of what you're thinking, but different), and more. Do you know what any of that is? Good. Me neither. I've got the 4 basic literal types down though, so hire me?

The biggest project we tackled throughout the week was the TodoMVC. Breaking it down for you -- that's "Todo" as in a reminder list, and "MVC" as in Model View Controller. Sounds easy. It isn't. I hate it. It hates me. It's harmony. Wiring up the basic functionality of a Todo list application is a bitch. It probably shouldn't be, but it is for me at this point. Between trying to use .js in the browser for the first time, trying to get familiar with MVC and where the divisions lie between Model / Controller and Controller / View, I got pretty disheartened.

The final tally of my week 2 projects
1) TodoMVC - :crying:
2) Blueprints

It wasn't all terrible. I got some tools for working offline (browser-sync, which is awesome) and the best website ever for finding shortcuts for every (emoji)[www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com] ever.
