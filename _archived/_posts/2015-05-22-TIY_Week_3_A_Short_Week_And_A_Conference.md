title: TIY Week 3 - A Short Week and a Conference to Boot
---

Oh man. Let me tell you a story about the time that I attended a 2 day conference on a Thurs and Fri, followed immediately by a 3 day weekend, all in the middle of an intensive front end development bootcamp lasting a TOTAL of 12 weeks! Lolwut?! Sounds some kind of wonderful, no? A nice little break after almost 3 weeks in the program? Yeah? No? Yes and no? Something like that. Said perfect storm happened to our cohort at the end of week 3. Most of the group left for _Front End Design Conf_ in St. Pete on Wednesday evening, and we saw numerous speakers over 2 days before heading back to Orlando Friday evening. The conference itself was terrific (more on that later), but I do wish the timing would've worked out a little differently for our group. It's pretty apparent we'll be doing what it takes to play catchup in the next few weeks....and that I'm going to become a zombie sooner than later. As an aside, if you haven't seen the movie Warm Bodies, watch it. Its got zombies and stuff.

All was not lost in week 3! We took a dive into CSS, which was a departure from the straight JavaScript path we had taken up to that point. CSS has some pretty awesome capabilities and was a welcome change for me after continually receiving an ass kicking at the hands of the TodoMVC in week 2. I also made a JavaScript breakthrough after the conference, when I was able to wire up some tabs with a `'click'` event listener that displayed corresponding panels on the click! I feel like that shouldn't have been so hard, but anything that resembles progress is welcomed. We also got our weekly collection of new tools that we can use to make our lives as developers easier. `Dash` is the ultimate documentation dump. By downloading the appropriate documentation from Dash in advance, I now have no excuses for failing to get work done because of wifi issues. Curse you browser-sync and Dash.....curse you. We used `bower` for the first time to install dependencies and wrap them in a nice bow as well. The bow being a bower.json file. Also, I have to give a quick shoutout to flux! Keeping my eyes safe in the eves since 2015.

##### So CSS?

That's _Cascading Style Sheets_ for you anti acronym antichrists out there. CSS is used to style the markup included in an HTML document. Put plainly, it provides style to the content of a webpage. Sounds simple enough. Except it's not. On a conceptual level, it's easier to discuss than something like JavaScript, and easier to google too. But playing with a .css file for only a few minutes is enough to convince anyone that it can be learned, but difficult to master. Over time, I know I'll become more comfortable creating stylesheets, but it's definitely going to be a process. I'm pretty sure there are 1 million properties that can be used to style HTML elements. (Not literally). I'm anxious to see what this SASS deal is all about too. See you in week 4, you sASS.

##### Front End Design Conf

As I mentioned previously, I got to attend the Front End Design Conference in St. Pete on Thursday, 5/21 and Friday, 5/22. Being it was my first conference, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from the conference sessions, or even the after hour meetups. It ended up being a great experience. Both Designers and front end developers were in attendance, and industry leaders across the front end spectrum gave some terrific presentations. Presentations on .svg files, animation, and general website weight especially resonated with me, though I wasn't able to follow everything presented with 100% accuracy (3 weeks green people). I was also pleasantly surprised by how friendly everyone was that I spoke with, no matter his or her experience in the industry. It was great to hear from several people that support TIY and its programs.

##### Coding bootcamp week 3 "tips for survival"
3 weeks down, and I'm suddenly realizing how less exciting it is to be writing this list each week. It should probably look like this:
```
1 "Prepare for Hell"
2 "Prepare for Hell"
3 "Prepare for Hell"
.
.
.
n "Prepare for Hell"
```

However, as is customary, included below is my tips for surviving week 3 in a coding bootcamp:

```
Tips for surviving week 3
  1) Select a cohort where a relevant conference and holiday fall on the same weekend within the course calendar
     * This speaks for itself
     * It's great until Tuesday until tuesday :sad_face:
  2) Never play a game of 'never have I ever' with your fellow cohort members in a remote city while drinking overpriced beers
     * Actually, do this
  3) Practice the pomodoro technique or productivity will suffer
     * My buzzer went off 45 min ago....
  4) Don't get used to any specific eating schedule
     * I eat dinner sometime between 6:30 p.m. and 6 a.m. everyday...pretty regular
  5) Seriously, stop bulldogging!
  6) Avoid getting discouraged by testing your progress against code school courses
     * You'll go through them so much faster than you did before
     * You're learning even if it feels like you're failing
  7) Find relief it isn't week 4 yet
     * My brain is mush
```
