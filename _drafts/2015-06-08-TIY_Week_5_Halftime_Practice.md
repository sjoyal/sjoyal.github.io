## What Once Was a Plan Was Not

Week 5 at TIY = done. It was a weird one. In a neither good nor bad way. Just weird. We began the week with the possibility of covering new material, or tapping the breaks for a recap week, starting on Tuesday. Worse, the decision was ours to make. Option A - Cover new material in week 5 and take halftime in week 6, or Option B - Take a halftime break in week 5, then go back to new material in week 6. Collectively, the cohort opted to take the halftime week, as opposed to covering new material. And while there were some that were more vocal with their opinion than others, the cohort definitely embraced the no man left behind concept. I didn't expect any type of halftime week when I first got to TIY, but after experiencing the information dump through the first third of the course, I'm beginning to see why it's needed. P.S. I voted to push forward and take a halftime break in week 6.

#### So what did I learn during halftime week?

Turns out, not a whole lot. At least in terms of new tools. Instead, I got to spend a lot of time reworking some of the projects we've previoussly worked on throughout the first month of the course. 


Tuple
* A finite ordered list of elements
* This is what happens when you stumble upon some moves and a chessboard and/or calling things in a function based on index number of an array (works, but prolly not smart)
* Example, an array of data that must be used in a specific way, the index of elements matters
* But I'm scare of objects kind of sort of

Use doc blocks when defining functions
* best practice for semantic .js
* first step in eventually using robots to turn info into documentation (e.g., jsdoc)
* Example:
```
/**
 * multiply two numbers
 * @param [number] a
 * @param [number] b
 * @return [number] product
 */
 function (a, b) {
   return a * b;
 };
```

Fetch things from an api in multiple ways
* curl -i <URL>, GET, or POSTMAN
* Push the output of a command in terminal into a file name as specified (ex: command > filename.extension)

Babel js
* Use ECMAScript6 today
* Compiler takes next generation JS and translates it into ES5 for use today
* This might be beneficial when I become competent in ES6

perfect pixel
* Put a semi-transparent image overlay over the top of developed html

Jekyll
* Ruby static site generator that takes basic text files, applies basic styling, and creates a website

How to survive week 5 list or any halftime week for that many
* Don't worry about finishing things, everything's been finished before (get better)
* Touch on everything, some in the cohort didn't do any js.....not for me
* Go to a Tom Cruise character costume party
* Regret that you aren't learning something new (where's my momentum?)
* Almost through the burnout phase. DON'T. GIVE. UP.
