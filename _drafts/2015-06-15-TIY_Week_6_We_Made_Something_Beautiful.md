## TIY Week 6 - We Made Something Beautiful

So week 6 at TIY happened, and it might've been my favorite week so far? Hard to decipher after the usual Tools on Tuesday mindfuck, and Wednesday's epic breakdown around 11:45 p.m. when I was trying to use `<template>` tags and loop through some json data to append a whole list of stuff to html. Turns out that's not as easy as it sounds. Doesn't help that I know Angular is coming, which I'm guessing will make that entire process that much easier. But by the end of the week, I was feeling really great putting things together from week 1 until present for our weekend project. To recap, we got more new tools to help with the yak shaving process, talked about APIs in a lot more detail, and actually created something tangible from thin air. Unfortunately, I think the feeling might be fleeting because there's still so much to learn (if you're familiar with my journal writing pattern/schedule, you'll know this is more than just a little foreshadowing).

#### So tools....

The big tool we got in week 6 was definitely Sass aka "syntactically awesome style sheets". Sass is a css preprocessor that makes styling html much easier. At least that's how it's promoted. In reality, it provides a couple convenient features (assigning variables, nesting selectors, and extending selectors), and then a whole bunch of useful stuff that will take me somewhere between weeks and forever to learn. Like what the hell is a mixin? Seriously. Anyway, I can definitely see some value there, and it'll only increase over time. We also covered include wiredep and how to incorporate that into our yak shaving process. Pretty cool feature, and another thing I can add to my package.json scripts. Which brings me to the other big thing we learned in week 6: JSON. We spent a good amount of time covering APIs and making requests from them for data represented in a json object. There's a mush in my brain for things like promises, callbacks, ajax, $.getJSON, and .then methods......Hopefully working with APIs the next few weeks provides some clarity.
