## TIY Week 6 - We Made Something Beautiful

So week 6 at TIY happened, and it might've been my favorite week so far? Hard to decipher after the usual Tools on Tuesday mindfuck, and Wednesday's epic breakdown arund 11:45 p.m. when I was trying to use `<template>` tags and loop through some json data to append a whole list of stuff to html. Turns out that's not as easy as it sounds. Doesn't help that I know Angular is coming, which I'm guessing will make that entire process that much easier. But by the end, I was feeling really great putting things together from week 1 until present for our weekend project. To recap, we got more new tools to help with the yak shaving process, talked about APIs in a lot more detail, and actually created something tangible from thin air. Unfortunately, I think the feeling might be fleeting because there's still so much to learn (if you're familiar with my journal writing pattern/schedule, you'll know this is more than just a little foreshadowing).

#### So tools....

The big tool we got in week 6 was definitely Sass aka "syntactically awesome style sheets". Sass is a css preprocessor that makes styling html much easier. At least that's how it's promoted. Really it provides a couple convenient features (assigning variables, nesting selectors, and extending selectors), and then a whole bunch of useful stuff that will take a good bit of time to master. Like what the hell is a mixin?

* wiredep
* a little more info on using npm scripts
* sassssss
  * Easy to use, won't use to full potential for a while I'm guessing
  * WTF is a mixin again?
* API's - Restful vs (we havn't covered it yet)
  * Getting some dictionaries via JSON
* Promise
  * Not that I really understand this or anything
* AJAX / $.getJSON
* data-attributes (when to use)
* Builing grids in HTML / CSS
  * I want proper alignment and gutters ya'll
* lodash \_.template
  * Mostly frustrating bc I know we will be learning a better way to do this very soon
* Something Beautiful
  * API mashup: Google places search and Dark Sky forecast API
  * Request some data
  * Put some data on the page
  * Style it with a pretty picture
  * Pat self on back

* Tips for surviving week 6
  * Pick a good partner for group projects!
  * Ask generic questions in class
