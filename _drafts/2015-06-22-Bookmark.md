#### Read 'dem Jekyll Docs!

For a relatively painless approach to building a personal or project site on the web, GitHub users can turn to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) to meet many of their needs. GitHub pages hosts up to 1 site per user, and 1 site per project, and works in tandem with [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) (a static site generator) to provide a solid platform for a typical site. Jekyll is specifically equipped for sites that include a large amount of content, including blog entries, a portfolio, etc. While setup for the site is pretty straight forward, the capabilities of Jekyll are a little more involved. I've included a link below for the Jekyll documentation that may come in handy during the build process.
