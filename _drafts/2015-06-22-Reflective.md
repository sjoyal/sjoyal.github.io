## Churning Along

* Tips for survival

#### A few thoughts on things...

Where is time going? I feel like I was writing about week 1 yesterday, and now week 7 is done. And I feel so unprepared. I know that my final project is looming (weeks 10-12), and I'm feeling a lot of things. Mainly scared. There are some patterns that are emerging, and my bulldogging until 2 a.m. each night has begun to catch up to me. Every Wednesday afternoon, but sometimes much earlier, I have a meltdown. I wonder, sometimes aloud, if I'm falling behind, if I'm not understanding concepts well enough, why I'm continuing to make the same silly syntax errors, why the leader guy teaches the way that he does...This shit is so hard. I want a nap. I want 12 naps. I want to go outside. I want to drink 27 beers.

This week, almost on cue, I ran into a brick wall when styling a `<nav>` bar on Wednesday afternoon. As you might've gathered from previous posts, style sheets and I have a very love hate, if not hate hate relationship. The `<nav>` bar I was working on had some lovely inline image boxes on the left and right, and then a random piece of shit box on the end that included 2 stacked lines of text. I'll admit it looked lovely, but I legit hate the person that created the reference implementation. After a few hours (yes, as in more than one....), I finally applied the vertical-align method properly. The vertical-align property that I've used several times before...it was so frustrating. It happened. I'm over it. I'll see you next Wednesday, Mr. Meltdown.

At the same time, I don't want to come off as bitter, unhappy, or with regret. I can already say that coming to this program has been the biggest challenge and best professional decision of my entire life. I've developed a love for always having my computer in my backpack. A love for pulling it out anywhere to try and get some quick work done. A love for the logic game that is trying to teach a stupid robot how to do something. I feel like I've finally found a home. And I hope it's a home where I will get to solve problems and learn every single day.

#### Group work hard

In hindsight, I don't think I ever discussed the layout of each week within the course. It's the other pattern that I can almost use to set my watch. Our week is structured as follows:
  * Monday: Homework review, parking lot topics, weekly yak-shaving
  * Tuesday: Tools on Tuesday (my brain explodes)
  * Wednesday: Build on Tuesday's introduced topics (I have a meltdown)
  * Thursday: Last push on Tuesday's introduced topics, receive weekend assignment (big mamma jamma)
  * Friday: Lab

This week our in-class and weekend project was creating a couple of various Etsy pages using cached date from the Etsy API. We worked in groups (mine had 4 members). It was hard, and a sobering look into the reality of working with a team of developers. Mind those merge conflicts y'all. During this weekend assignment, each day someone was designated as _team leader_. And the one caveat of being team lead? That person couldn't write any code the entire time. It was awful. I felt like I was going to lose momentum in the entire program if I didn't use my text editor for that one day. I realize now how stupid that sounds. Leader guy was trying to show us the value in reading other people's code and talking through problems with teammates. I think I see the purpose now. Also, I didn't forget how to write an IIFE, so we're all good.

#### Tools from Tuesday

In no particular order 
Bootstrap
 * Introduced as a grid tool
 * I don't need no stinking grid tool, I'm OG
 * Oh those other components are nice though

 vue.js
 * Another .js library for populating data from the model in the view
 * `v-repeat` is pretty handy
 * Angular.js I'm coming for you

 Building that gulpfile.js
 * This damn file does so much stuff
 * Run that browser sync on gulp serve, and watch that Sass while you're at it bro
 * Routing those bower components is a lovely speed bump too

#### How to survive week 7 at a coding bootcamp

A short list because I'd rather be brief than unoriginal. Go!

1.) Don't quit
2.) [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJY6RML__Ak) is normal.
3.) No advice on sleep / studying - Find what works best for you and run with it
