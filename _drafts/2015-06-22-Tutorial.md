### Displaying picture from selection in row of thumbnails w/ jQuery
 * Add event listeners that will dynamically listen for events by selecting parent element (always there on document load) and then using `.on('click', [child element])`
 * Trigger `activate` on click (separation of concerns)
 * On `activate`, set parent element class to active and remove class from siblings
 * Capture value of clicked child element using `$newImage = this.attr().replace(?? x ??)` and then set that value as value of main image attribute (`(.main-image).attr($newImage)`)
 * The replace portion of $newImage, replaces anything in the attr that should be changed (aka image size in the path?)
