## Collapsing the bootstrap responsive menu with jQuery

When I was working on my final project

* final project
* important to make it responsive
* navbar component from Bootstrap makes it easy to adjust with viewport width
* at the tablet breakpoint, the navbar converts to a collapsable hamburger menu
* this navbar by default must manually be closed after selecting a link
* we can use jQuery to automatically toggle the collapse of the menu:
``` JavaScript
      $('.navbar-nav li a').click(function(){
        var open = $('.navbar-toggle').is(':visible');
        if (open){
          $('.navbar-collapse').collapse('hide');
        }
      });
```
* since the navbar is a static item, we register a click event listener on page load
* We then create a variable _open_ indicating the navbar is toggled to visible
* create an _if_ statement that reads _open_ as a comparison operator that when evaluating to true, collapses the menu with the .collapse method from bootstrap
