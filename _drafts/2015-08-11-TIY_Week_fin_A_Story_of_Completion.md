## A Graduate of The Iron Yard

12 weeks down. 0 journals for over 4 weeks....and I'm done at The Iron Yard. The hardest thing I've ever done, and it's not close. To recap, that's 12 straight weeks of 12-16 hour days, including weekends. I legitimately took 2 Saturdays off the entire time, and never a Sunday. Since my last post I learned AngularJS and used it and Firebase to build my [final project](https://iron-pong.firebaseapp.com), updated my resume, started saying bye to Orlando(maybe?), reworked my resume, created my [portfolio site](https://sjoyal.github.io), drank some beers, and slept some naps.

I'll spare the nitty gritty of my final project and portfolio site since all the code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/sjoyal) anyway. The only hiccup I encountered on the portfolio site was building something without the help of a generator to get started. Having not built something without Yeoman's help for over 7 weeks spoiled me a bit. I will say that I'm extremely proud of both. People are using the app I made for my final project, and I created my portfolio from scratch without the help of any template. So shit yeah. From coming in without the ability to make anything except a [MF'ing website](motherfuckingwebsite.com), to where I am now, I'm happy. But I do already miss several things about being a student at The Iron Yard. More on that later.

Oh yeah, I presented my final project in front of more than 80ish people (confirmed by no one) on demo day. Which was kind of alright. There's video somewhere, and I'll have to find it for Mom.

#### Where do I go from here?

Like really. I have no idea.

The big decision I'm facing is deciding where I'm gonna do this career thing? Jacksonville in one hand and Orlando/other places in the other. Jax is my home but has less opportunity, and Orlando is kind of a tech hotspot. Both have advantages and disadvantages. Nothing will ever be permanent, but it's a tough scenario to work through in my head. That's why I think I'm going to look and pursue in both places, and then go wherever I can find that puts me in a good place to continue learning on a great dev team. _I don't even know if that's feasible._ We'll see what happens. There will always be skeptics of the kind of program I went through, but if nothing else I know how fast I learned and how determined I am to continue learning....just have to convince and employer of the same thing. For those reading cross your fingers and toes plz. Couldn't hurt!

I mentioned missing being a student at TIY earlier, and it's true. The schedule and workload, as effing ridiculous as it was, was still a set schedule. It was a routine, a chance to keep learning, and it was familiar.

  * **Be at standup by 9AM everyday**
    * I was never late, and was 45 min or more early at 95% of the time
  * **Homework every night**
    * TV is overrated
  * **Groupwork**
    * The area I need the most improvement
  * **Instruction from a respected developer in the tech community**
    * You mean I have to teach myself now? This is a tricky one. I could argue I taught myself most of what I learned at TIY, but still.

In the two weeks since the course ended, I've spent equal amounts of time working on code, my job search materials, sleeping, and driving back and forth to Orlando so that I can work in TIY's space. Where's the structure in that? There's no rhythm. Step 1 will be re-establishing that rhythm:

  * Job search by morning
  * Code by afternoon

I'm thinking reworking the todoMVC with a different JS framework will be a good starting point, and then maybe some online ruby courses. Anyone reading that wants help with a project, I can add the semicolons! Maybe style some buttons? If we're feeling crazy. If you follow me on twitter, I reference the line "95% excited and 5% scared" from the movie Armageddon, often. Owen Wilson is so clever, he later says it might be the other way around. I'm definitely the other way around. But I know I like code, and maybe for the first time ever I don't have any buyer's remorse about a decision I've made. Time to get to work.

#### The final tips for surviving The Iron Yard, from start to finish
 * do more pre-work, I didn't do much at all, and that's why I get 10 minutes of sleep in 3 months
 * trust the process, if you put in the work you'll succeed
 * learn how to plan and understand scope (establish an MVP before the first line of code is written)
 * get to know your cohort members, they're all probably awesome in different ways
 * attend more meetups, especially the ones that serve free beer. Shoutout to [cloudspace](http://cloudspace.com) for their meetup goodness
 * help your fellow cohort members - I think I helped a lot and still feel like I didn't do a good enough job
 * have fun. I did.
