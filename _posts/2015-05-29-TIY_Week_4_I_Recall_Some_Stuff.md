## TIY Week 4 - I Remember Everything and Don't. Same time like, ya dig?

#### What I learned?
Oh hey week 4. Bye week 4. That was quick right? I'll just go ahead and say that I have the feeling this post might read like an inverted bell shape. Like super high --> down in the dumps --> super high again. Actually, I know it will...I already wrote an outline. What? You don't write an outline for blog posts? Fuck you. No, really. Way too much in this brain for word vomit. I only word vomit on the keys when it's 2am and I've been tapping rockies, keeping it natural, or hipster sipping on that silver, white, red, and blue can -- I don't condone product placement in my blog. Anyway, week 4 is freaking done. And I"m super excited it's over. We did a lot. I retained most of it. Recalling things verbally is another story. That's what a Memorial Day holiday will do for you.

**The deets of what I remember**  
Alert the presses, there's something known as HTML that kind of holds the content of web pages and stuff. Like, the words, and maybe some pictures and stuff. Under the hood is a bit different, but learning the tags is easy enough. Really, I didn't struggle too much getting familiar with HTML, but if our group doesn't start learning that anything equal to something else within a tag is an _ATTRIBUTE_, the leader dude is going to chop our heads off. Maybe next week..... Also, CSS doesn't stop after week three. Turns out layout is kind of a bitch. And media queries, while a simple concept, are kind of time consuming. Add in the fact that I type way too much in the text editor already and we've got a slight issue. I'm gonna master refactoring one day. But yeah, layout is tough. A post regarding the box model is currently in the works <-- (Absolutely no earth shattering information will be presented in said box model post, but should help me retain it, so read it. Or don't.) We had some basic conversations this week regarding responsive vs adaptive design and designing for mobile screens vs web screens first. The lazy side of me says I think adaptive design is redundant and annoying, and that I'm gonna have to design for mobile screen and web screen first at various times in my life. The smart side of me says I have no idea what I'm talking about, but at least I don't look at websites the same way anymore.

Show of hands for who knows what Semantic Versioning is...I'm raising mine, you aren't, Mom. Read about that [HERE](http://semver.org/), and never wonder what those numbers for OS X releases are ever again. As an aside, I feel like I should mention how we totally keep effffing up git stuff each week _on purpose_ per our ~~dictator~~ fearless leader. This week, we discussed using `git rebase` on a royally screwed repo with about 2 trillion million forks. Joy. Really though, rebase might be the best way to clear merge conflicts among forks that have diverged way too many times. There's an abort option, at least.

#### Tools in week 4! OMG YESSS WHAT YESZZ!
Ok, I talk about the tools we receive every week. This week is no different. But unlike most other weeks, except for say week 1, I'm usually embellishing how much I really believe they make my life easier. That's NOT the case in week 4! I promise, it's not. That's why I'm abandoning the typical paragraph format for some isolated discussion:

**`Yeoman`**
   * Yeoman is a scaffolding tool for the modern web, and its very noice. Created to get a project up and running quickly, Yeoman uses best practices to construct a package of the correct files in the correct places, pointing to the right things. Even cooler, you call a generator using the `$ yo <generatorName>` command. It's glorious, and it has already helped me with the following generators:
    * `h5bp` - (html5Boilderplate) Includes the basics we need to start a project (e.g., index.html, css/, js/, and LICENSE.txt)
    * :wave: `mocha` - Where chai once lived, mocha made me quit you (not literally, I get both for the price of one in a lovely tests folder and test.js file)

**`json files`**
   * package.json and bower.json files are files including various information about a project like its name, version, main pages, dependencies, and scripts to run at various times. These files make it extremely simple to install the related dependencies for a project if you are not the original contributor (just run `npm install`, `bower install`, etc.). The scripts section of package.json is also especially useful for adding browser-sync start paths for testing and watching files.
   
**`Skitch`**
   * I have no idea if I discussed this last week. And that will take to long to check, so I'm mentioning it again (or maybe for the first time?). Skitch is a free, easy to use tool that let's the user add stuff to screen shots as part of the planning/mockup process. Praying this is all I need in the design realm, I don't design.

#### Other tidbits about life
I turned 32 on Saturday. That was funny. I'm old. My family visiting two weekends ago, and my friends visiting last weekend was an awesome break from all this mental sludge. Special shoutout to my sister for the Starbucks gift cards. <--Helping me get through TIY on the cheap since day one! Aside from those things, my brain is basically mush. I struggle to stay awake from 6-8pm each night. It's currently 7:30pm. This program is officially the hardest thing I've ever done. I've called things hard before, but I'll be the first to admit most of those times were situations where I wasn't applying myself at nearly the level needed. That's not the case this time. They compared this course to military boot camp on day one - positioning it as a mental variation. I get it. I see it. The good thing is, I will not fail in this program. I'm not sure I've every applied myself and/or been this motivated in my entire life. I don't have kids, so that's out. I don't count traditional schooling because I was young and naive. Sure, I worked hard, but I didn't know the stakes. So that's out too. This program takes the cake. 7 weeks to go.

#### Tips for surviving week 4
Per the usual, my tips for anyone in a bootcamp cohort for week 4:

```
1) Piss off the instructor - has to happen eventually
2) Get pissed off by the instructor - samesies!
3) Walk away from the computer for a full hour on lunch
4) YOU CANNOT FINISH EVERYTHING
5) Do the basic assignment from each day - save extracurriculars for another time
6) This is the burnout period of the program
  * The newness is waying off
  * The end is seems so far away
  * Extracurriculars overloading your brain will do more harm than good
7) Get comfortable showing your code to people (:waves: tutorial)
  * My stuff is offensive to look at and I can't refactor for shit, but let them trolls judge me for trying - I'll be over here doing me
8) Talk to people about what the program is like - I'll take an indirect pat on the back over zero pats on the back any day
```

Toodles.
