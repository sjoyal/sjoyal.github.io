## Getting Rid of Unwanted Space Between Inline-Block Elements

Recently, while attempting to finish recreating the Full Width Tabs blueprint (see the reference implementation [HERE](http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/FullWidthTabs/)), I encountered an issue that gave me fits for longer than I care to admit. As part of the blueprint's responsive design, the tabs at the top of the screen reduce in size, and eventually sit next to each other in a row without any white space between them. Being new to HTML and CSS, I was clueless as to what was even creating the whitespace AND had no idea where to begin to fix it. Enter CSS-Tricks! The article included below includes information about the cause of the mysterious white space between inline-block elements, and how to fix it.
