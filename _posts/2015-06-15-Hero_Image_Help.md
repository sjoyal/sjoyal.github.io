### Hero Images for the Trendy

One of the current (_dying?_) trends in web design is the inclusion of a hero image as the background of a site or as a large span header. According to my research (I read at least 2 articles on the web), these images are intended to immediately engage a visitor, and encourage him or her to dive further into the content available within a page. Regardless of personal opinions on the hero image phenomenon, every front end developer will probably need to include an image of that sort at some point. The problem? Hero images are very large and should have a very high resolution in order to cover such a large area on most screens. That size generally dictates a professional quality photo. Those.....are not free. Luckily, the internet has several sites that offer them for free download and without any restriction on use (even commercial). One such site that I've used personally is [Gratisography](http://www.gratisography.com/#0). Browse the collection at Gratisography or conduct your own search online, and start getting your hero on.
