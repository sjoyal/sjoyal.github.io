## TIY Week 6 - We Made Something Beautiful

So week 6 at TIY happened, and it might've been my favorite week so far? Hard to decipher after the usual Tools on Tuesday mindfuck, and Wednesday's epic breakdown around 11:45 p.m. when I was trying to use `<template>` tags and loop through some json data to append a whole list of stuff to html. Turns out that's not as easy as it sounds. Doesn't help that I know there are more efficient methods coming to handle this...ways I'm guessing will make that entire process that much easier. But by the end of the week, I was feeling really great putting things together from week 1 until present for our weekend project. Unfortunately, I think the feeling might be fleeting because there's still so much to learn (and if you're familiar with my journal writing pattern/schedule, you'll know this is more than just a little foreshadowing).To recap, we got more new tools to help with the yak shaving process, talked about APIs in a lot more detail, and actually created something tangible from thin air. Score.

#### So tools....

The big tool we got in week 6 was definitely Sass aka "syntactically awesome style sheets". Sass is a css preprocessor that makes styling html easier. At least that's how it's promoted. In reality, it provides a couple convenient features (assigning variables, nesting selectors, and extending selectors), and then a whole bunch of useful stuff that will take me somewhere between weeks and forever to learn. Like what the hell is a mixin? Seriously, what is it? Anyway, I can definitely see some value there, and it'll only increase over time. We also covered wiredep and how to incorporate that into our yak shaving process. Pretty cool feature, and another thing I can add to my package.json scripts. Speaking of json....that's the other big thing we learned in week 6. We spent a good amount of time covering APIs and making requests from them for data represented in a json object. There's a mush in my brain for things like promises, callbacks, ajax, $.getJSON, and .then methods, but hopefully working with APIs the next few weeks will provide some clarity.

Literally just remembered that it wasn't `<template>`` tags that caused me to melt down last week. It was building a reusable grid in Sass for consistent spacing and sizing in layouts. Pretty sure Bootstrap is in the pipeline at some point, but per usual, long hand method comes first. I'm not sure what part of the grid drove me insane, but I'm 99.99999% positive it involved some form of positioning, display, or float property. That stuff's just gonna take time. I bounced back, but while we're on the subject, I guess I'll come out and admit that CSS is my least favorite thing about the course so far. JavaScript is hard, html is easy, both are more fun to play with than CSS any day. Painting the house a new color and jacking up the price won't change my opinion of that, Sass. But it's all part of the deal, and I'll keep working at it until I get better. Just might sneak in a few more JavaScript katas in the coming weeks to keep my sanity.

#### WEEEEKEEEND PROJECT

This weekend was our first group project, and it was awesome. For our assignment, we were told to build something beautiful. Sounds generic, and I'm pretty sure that was intentional. There weren't any rules really, other than teams had to utilize 2 different APIs as part of the project. My first idea for the project got shot down by the leader guy, so I guess there were actually rules, but I digress. We had to form teams of 2, so I teamed up with my main man @mstaehling. We've worked together on assignments before, so it was a good pairing for me. Our main challenges were settling on what we wanted to do and being satisfied with the scope / not trying to incorporate too many stretch goals. It ended up going really well. We incorporated the Google places search API and the Dark Sky Weather API to build a site that encourages users to get outdoors and explore. Our end result was a site that was visually appealing and included cached data from the weather api. Our other end result was a list of what feels like 10 stretch goals. Instructor man says every project we ever work on will end that way, so at least we did something right.

#### Get to the TIPS!

Say no more. Here are my tips for making it through week 6 in a coding bootcamp. I can't believe I'm more than halfway done with the course. And more than 2/3 of the way done with new material. 3 weeks and counting until final projects begin....

**Tips for surviving week 6**
  * Pick a good partner for group projects!
  * Ask generic questions in class because you're gonna get generic answers anyway
  * Encourage your campus to start having meditation on Friday mornings
  * Bulldog everything -- there are no rules
  * Embrace the rabbit holes for the learning that takes place along the way
  * Read everything -- I google things on my phone all day just to wet the sponge if it's something I want to research later
  * Stop eating pizza
  * Fantasize about sleep in another 6 weeks
