title: Picking Colors as a Non-Designer
---

## Newsflash....I'm Not a Designer

When I started down the path of becoming a developer, I had a very specific reason for choosing the front end route vs backend. I had some creative genes (see writing in my previous gigs), as well as some major analytical quirks that needed to see some light of day. Enter front end development, and the opportunity to create while also fueling my left brain analytical tendencies. So far so good. The problem? Colors. Colors and design. The theories behind colors and design. You see the trend here. My creative brain isn't _THAT_ creative. Please give me a .psd file that I can create with HTML and Sass. If you don't, I'm going to put a massive hero image in the project because why stress over something when you can cheat? Right? A simple look at my final project and mashup project when I was student at The Iron Yard are classic examples. For the record, I didn't use a hero image for my portfolio site, and that was intentional. I'm like a 23 year old actor in Los Angeles that's afraid of being typecast.

Sooooo, I decided to create a single page scrolling portfolio site with some colors for each background section. Considering I'm a color idiot with 0 design background, I decided to use a site to tell me which colors work together best. Enter [Adobe Kuler](https://color.adobe.com), an awesome site that makes it supa simple.

Full disclosure, I didn't end up using multiple colors from the site for my [portfolio site](https://sjoyal.github.io). I just stole one, and then used a grayish off-white color for another section. Still.....I can see the value of the site. You should too. Happy coloring.
