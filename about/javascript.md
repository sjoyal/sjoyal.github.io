## Javascript

#### Basic Literal Types:
* **null** - Empty value (i.e. no object is present); retrieved in places where an object can be expected, but no object is relevant aka known to exist but no value; behaves as 0
* **Boolean** - Logical data type that can only have the output of true or false
  *
* **Number** - Numeric data type in the double-precision 64-bit floating point format (IEEE 754)
  * 42 or 3.14159 
* **String** - Sequence of characters used to represent text
  * "Howdy"

#### Special Constants
* **Infinity** - Numeric value representing infinity; The value is greater than any other number.
  * Any positive number multiplied by infinity equals infinity
  * Any number divided by infinity equals zero
* **NaN** - Value representing Not_A_Number 
  * Returned value when Math functions fail (math.sqrt(-1)) or when a function trying to parse a number fails (parseInt("blabla"))
* **undefined** - Variable that has not been assigned a value
  * Method or Statement also returns undefined if variable being evaluated does not have an assigned value
  * Function returns undefined if a value was not returned

####Basic Operators
* **'+'** - The addition operator produces the sum of numeric operands or string concatenation
    
`Operator: x + y`
* **'-'** - The subtraction operator subtracts the two operands, producing their difference
    
`Operator: x - y`
* **'/'** - The division operator produces the quotient of its operands where the left operand is the dividend and the right operand is the divisor
    
`Operator: x / y`
