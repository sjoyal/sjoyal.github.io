The gorwth mindset versus fixed mindset debate encompasses two ways of thinking related to individuals and their abilities to learn. Central to the debate is the belief that individuals are either pre-destined to obtain a certain level of intelligence, or that intelligence is fostered in all individuals through proper teaching techniques. Stanford professor Carol Dweck has discussed this "Nature vs Nurture" debate at length and champions the growth mindset as the most effective way to develop intelligence at a high level in any individual. 

Several distinct traits are associated with growth and fixed mindsets. Common traits associated with a fixed mindset include a desire to cheat, to run from difficulty, to look for someone worse, and to believe that some people are just born with natural ability. Common traits associated with a growth mindset include the desire to engage deeply, to appreciate a challenge, to believe that intelligence can be developed, and overall confidence and happiness. Dr. Dweck has identified the fundamental steps required to shift from a fixed to a growth mindset as a means for individuals to reach their full potential. The process, bridging the gap from not yet to yet, includes three steps: praise, reward process, and change mindsets. Educators, parents, and mentors should consider the appropriate way to give praise, reward process, and change the mindset of pupils. In doing so, pupils will display more effort, strategies, engagement, and perserverance than peers stuck in a fixed mindset.

Recently, I experienced traits on both ends of the mindset spectrum. Attempting to accomplish a long-time goal, I began learning the guitar in December 2014. Within days, I was sure I would never reach a competent level of playing ability and considered quitting. I was sure that people must be born with natural ability, and I was not one of those people. The trait I displayed was a classic result of a fixed mindset. However, I committed to a daily practice routine and slowly saw incremental improvement. Within months, I began receiving praise from friends about my hard work and practice time paying off. While they did not make outrageous claims about me mastering the guitar, they motivated me to continue practicing in the future. My friends had praised me in a way that rewarded my process, and in turn it fostered a growth mindset within me. Going foward, I am confident that I will continue making incremental improvements if I continue my commitment to my practice routine.

At The Iron Yard, it is easy to see the ways a person can fall into a fixed mindset trap. The course material is presented in an intensive way that leads to repeated failures as a student. However, by acknowledging that failure is part of the process and necessary for development, I believe it is possible to maintain the appropriate growth mindset needed for success. Throughout the course, I plan to embrace each new challenges, think process, and trust that continued development is the outcome.
